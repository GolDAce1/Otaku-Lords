                <h3>Just who the hell do you think we are?</h3>
               <p> We are an international clan for weebs across the globe. If you like anime, manga or anything else related to japanese pop culture? That means you finally found the place you have been looking for! </p>
                 
                  
                <h3>What type of clan is this?</h3>
                <p> The first and most important thing to remember is.. We are made this clan for enjoyment, time pass and to have fun with members with similar interests. We take clan chest seriously tho.. but we arent forcing anyone to get crowns all the time.
                      <br /> 
                    We do have a few rules tho..
                   <br />
                   1) Donate or you get kicked instantly.
                   <br />
                   2) Dont swear too much we try to maintain PG-13 at all times.
                   <br />
                   3) Try to get Atleast 20 crowns in the clan chest.. if you cant do that..go ahead and inform the reason to a Co-Lead or the Lead himself. </p>
               
                   <h3>Whats the group chat thingy?</h3>
                   We try to keep the clan chat classy, tho sometimes we do talk for hours and hours.. If you want pure random chat anout any topic, than join our instagram group chat.
                  <br />
                   Every member can join it! ( wait their is an age limit tho..   ) 
                   <br /> 
                   If you do wanna join the clan and its full? No worries you can just message the lead directly on insta.. and we might make a place for you soon. Till the time comes you can enter our group chat just to get along with the members in the clan
